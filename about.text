üìß AI-Powered Email Reply Generator using Spring Boot and Gemini API
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to automatically generate professional email replies based on the tone and content of a received email. It leverages Google's Gemini AI (via Gemini API) for natural language understanding and response generation, and is built using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React, if extended) for the frontend.



üîß Key Features:
Natural Language Response Generation
Uses Google's Gemini API to generate AI-powered email replies based on the given input and selected tone.

Tone Customization
Users can specify the desired tone (e.g., friendly, professional, apologetic) to tailor the style of the generated email response.

RESTful API with Spring Boot
A clean API architecture built using Spring Boot that handles incoming JSON requests, builds prompts, makes API calls, and returns generated responses.

Interactive Frontend Interface
A simple and interactive UI built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to allow users to enter email content and select a tone.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack:
Component	Technology
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (can extend to React)
Backend	Spring Boot (Java)
API	Gemini (Google Generative AI API)
Deployment	Localhost / IntelliJ IDEA / Postman

üì¨ How It Works:
The user types or pastes an email that needs a reply.

They select or type the desired tone of the response.

On form submission, the frontend sends a POST request to the Spring Boot backend.

The backend constructs a prompt using the provided content and tone, and sends it to the Gemini API.

The AI-generated reply is returned and displayed to the user.
